# 377-Operating-Systems-Final-Project
In this project, I implemented the MLFQ scheduling algorithm into an existing scheduling algorithm program. 

I extended Project 3 - Scheduler and I added my implemention of the MLFQ algorithm into the file scheduling.cpp. I included a main method implemmenting the different aspects of the algorithm, and I included a helper method that calculated the process with the highest priority as well.
