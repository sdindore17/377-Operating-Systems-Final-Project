# 377-Operating-Systems-Final-Project
In this project, I implemented the MLFQ scheduling algorithm into an existing scheduling algorithm program. 

I extended Project 3 - Scheduler and I added my implemention of the MLFQ algorithm into the file scheduling.cpp. I included a main method implemmenting the different aspects of the algorithm, and I also included a helper method that calculated the process with the highest priority. 

The main mlfq method finds the highest priority process that arrived at the earliest time, and it calculates the amount of time a process waits before its priority value gets reduced. The helper method, lowestVal, finds the process with the highest priority (lowest priority value).
